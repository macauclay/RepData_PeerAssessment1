## Loading and preprocessing the data

unzip("activity.zip")

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

####1.Make a histogram 

StepsTotal <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, FUN = sum)

hist(StepsTotal$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")

####2.The mean and median is

mean(StepsTotal$steps)

median(StepsTotal$steps)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

time_series <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)

plot(row.names(time_series), time_series, type = "l", xlab = "5-min interval", 
    ylab = "Average across all Days", main = "Average number of steps taken", 
    col = "red")

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
