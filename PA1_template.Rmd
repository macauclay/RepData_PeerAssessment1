## Loading and preprocessing the data

unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

#1. Make a histogram
StepsTotal <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
barplot(StepsTotal$steps, names.arg = steps.date$date, xlab = "date", ylab = "steps")

mean(StepsTotal$steps)
median(StepsTotal$steps)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

time_series <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
